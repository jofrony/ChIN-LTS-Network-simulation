# ChIN-LTS-Network-simulation
Simulations for ChIN-LTS network with extrinsic cortical and thalamic input - with nitric oxide and muscarinic modulation



### Installing the environment

Install miniconda and NEURON according to the instructions: https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download/compile_linux


 The following modules are needed:

 elephant==0.6.4
 bluepyopt==1.8.64
 matplotlib==3.0.3
 neo==0.8.0
 neuron==7.6
 numpy==1.17.3
 pip==19.3.1
 quantities==0.12.3
 
 The simulations are divided for each figure and can be simulated using for example:
 
  
 ```
python Figure6-thalamic-synapse.py 

 ```

The results will be in Output-folder
