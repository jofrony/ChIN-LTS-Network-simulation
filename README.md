# ChIN-LTS-Network-simulation
Simulations for ChIN-LTS network with extrinsic cortical and thalamic input - with nitric oxide and muscarinic modulation


### Installing the environment

Using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

Install NEURON according to the instructions: [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download/compile_linux)
 
The simulationsare done via running the following command, for example for Figure 6 thalamic synapse simulation for ChINs:
 
  
 ```
python Figure6-thalamic-synapse.py 

 ```

The results will be in Output-folder.
